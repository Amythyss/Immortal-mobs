## Can you make a version for Minecraft [version] ?
As stated previously, this datapack is created for personal use, therefore I won't unless I use that version.

You **can** however:
- Clone this datapack and change it so that it works in your version (You are required to follow the [License](https://github.com/riddemon/Immortal-mobs?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file#readme)).
- Create a datapack that does the exact same thing but in your version.

## Someone cloned your datapack and is taking credit for it.
Everyone is allowed to distribute my datapack but has to state any changes[^2], therefore has to credit me regardless of changes being made or not.
Please make them aware of this and ask them to make the necessary changes.

## You haven't updated the datapack in months / years!
This may be for an extensive number of reasons. Here's what you can do:
- Create an issue about it.
  - I may have forgotten about it.
  - I may be working on it.
  - I may have designated someone to continue on my work.
- Fork this datapack and create an updated version[^2].
  - **Depending on the changes you made** you may be requested to delete your datapack to avoid conflicts with the original one.
- Wait and hope.
